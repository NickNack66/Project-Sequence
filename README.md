# Project-Sync
This is where we will put all of our code. It also allows us to create multiple copies of code to experiment, as well as handle version control.

Make sure to do the GitHub tutorial to understand how this works. You should be creating a new branch whenever you edit and using pull requests when you are satisfied with your edits.
